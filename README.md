# SceneView Bookmarks
 Scene View shortcuts to bookmark view positions and states (layer visibility and locked state, shading mode, lighting, effects, grid visibility, etc).

# Features
- Save/Load SceneView Bookmarks (position, direction, ortho/persp, 2D, Shading Mode, View States (Skybox, Fog, etc), grid, gizmos, visible and locked layers).
- Built-in Views (Perspective, Top, Front, UI).
- Cameras/Cinemachine Virtual Cameras shortcuts.
- Filters (LOD Group, Collider, Renderer, Metadata).
- Bookmarks Editor Window.
- Link Main Camera (or current Virtual Camera) to Scene View.

# Known Limitations
- If a Camera is Linked and a Bookmark is recalled, the Camera is moved without warning.

# Future Improvements
- Saving to Editor / Project Settings (currently saves to Assets/SceneViewBookmarks.json).
- A better Editor View with Reorderable List.
